Build Instructions
------------------
If the git source repository has been cloned then your environment must support
the GNU Build System "Autotools" (GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake and GNU Libtool).
After cloning the repository generate the configure script and Makefile.ins with
the following:

    > ./autogen.sh

However if you have fetched and unpacked a distribution tarball you environment
does not need to support "Autotools" since the configure script and Makefile.ins
are included in the tarball.

To build use the following command with N set to the number of available CPU
cores:

    > ./configure
    > make -s -jN

To run the test suites run the following:

    > make -s check

Installing
----------
The default installation root directory is ${prefix}/nerlang where
${prefix}=/usr/lib. The prefix directory can be set using the --prefix argument
when running the configure script.

Running
-------
To run the eshell:

    > nerl

To compile:

    > nerlc

Distributing
------------
A tarball distribution can be made using:

    > make dist

The integrity of a tarball distribution can be tested using:

    > make distcheck
